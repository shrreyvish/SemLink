# Smart Semantic Note Linking and Visualizer

## Abstract
The digital note-taking market is experiencing an explosion in adoption, valued at approximately $9.5 billion in 2024 and projected to reach $23.8 billion by 2029. This growth is driven by a shift from linear filing to "networked thought" via applications like Obsidian and Roam Research. While research suggests that graph-based visualizations can reduce cognitive load by up to 20% through spatial mapping, these systems face a significant scaling bottleneck.

As digital vaults grow to thousands of entries, the manual overhead of creating meaningful links becomes impractical, leading to "digital graveyards" of siloed information. This project addresses the "link degradation" problem by investigating automated semantic note linking. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to infer contextual relationships rather than simple keyword overlap, the system constructs a sparse, interpretable knowledge graph. This work evaluates various similarity models to ensure semantic coherence and improved usability for long-term knowledge management.

Modern tools like Obsidian have popularized networked note-taking, leveraging bidirectional linking to mirror the brain’s associative nature. Research indicates that graphical visualizations can reduce cognitive load by up to 20%, as spatial mapping helps users identify latent patterns and non-linear relationships. By transforming static text into dynamic nodes, these systems facilitate better information retrieval and long-term knowledge retention. However, the manual effort required to maintain these visual graphs at scale remains a primary barrier to their long-term utility

As the volume of digital notes increases, manually creating meaningful links between related concepts becomes impractical. This project investigates automated semantic note linking using Natural Language Processing techniques to infer contextual relationships between unstructured notes and represent them as a knowledge graph.

## Problem Statement
Graph-based note systems rely heavily on manual linking, which does not scale with large or long-term note collections. As a result, relationships between conceptually related notes remain unexpressed, limiting the usefulness of graph visualizations.

This project addresses the problem of automatically identifying and representing semantic relationships between notes without user intervention.

Similar solutions around "Document linking" for human interpretablity fall short by focusing on purely key-word matching approaches like [this one](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-note-linker-automatically-find-and-create-new-links-between-notes/41504)

Some ideas for how to visualize the semantic linking is given [here](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/have-we-finally-figuredout-semantic-links-aka-how2-cultivate-complex-link-properties-for-visualising-distinct-relationships/86732) even though some of those are a bit over-the-top and would only constitute UI complexity which is to be avoided.

## Objectives
- Infer semantic relationships between textual notes
- Compare keyword-based and embedding-based similarity methods
- Construct a sparse, interpretable note graph
- Analyze graph structure and semantic coherence
- Provide a CLI tool that allows for easy usage

## Evaluation Criteria
- Similarity score distributions
- Graph density and connectivity
- Qualitative inspection of inferred links
- Comparison between baseline and embedding-based methods

This project will follow the legacy `src` package layout for all core development. All logic is to be written in the `src/semlink/core/<file>.py` and required functionality is to be exposed via the `src/semlink/cli.py`
